A major advantage they point out is how open and willing to participate these respondants are to giving their data.
This can be viewed in 2 ways; first, it may seem very likely that people are certainly more willing to give info when it is done
via a simple survey, with no need for other human contact. The other, more relevant viewpoint is that people are actually less
willing to do so these days, simply because of privacy concerns and willingness to share any kind of data in light of how 
companies on the internet may treat your data, and your willingness to trust them.
